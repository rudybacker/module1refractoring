# Code Refactor Starter Code
REFACTORING

This is my refactoring of a website. The mock-up and codesnap are from the first module of the class.

Tasks:

1. Rid of div and replace with the appropriate semantic.

2. Consolidate repetive values pertaining to class, id or other elments.

3. Describe pictures or logos for screen reading technologies.

4. Note the changes I made to the HTML and CSS files of the webpage.
